		<p class="brandnewdesc1">EXO member Xiumin has released his long-awaited debut mini-album ‘Brand New’, along with a music video for its lead single of the same name.</p>
		<p class="brandnewdesc2">On September 26 at 6pm KST, the EXO vocalist dropped the music video for ‘Brand New’, the title track for his debut mini-album which arrived at the same time.</p>
		<p class="brandnewdesc3">In the new music video, Xiumin time travels through the different seasons throughout the year, from a snowy winter night to an outdoor picnic on a bright summer day. “Wake up the new me / Call you, oh, you / It’s too early to be surprised / Baby, let it loose, let it loose,” he sings on the groovy chorus.</p>
		<p class="brandnewdesc4">With the arrival of ‘Brand New’, Xiumin is now the seventh member of nine-piece K-pop boyband EXO to go solo. He follows bandmates Baekhyun, Chen, Suho, Lay, Kai and D.O in doing so.</p>
		<p class="brandnewdesc5">Prior to this release, Xiumin has participated in a number of unofficial solo projects in the years since. These include his SM Station project single ‘You’, as well as numerous original soundtracks to K-dramas throughout the years, including 2020’s Mr. Queen and Falling For Challenge in 2015.</p>
